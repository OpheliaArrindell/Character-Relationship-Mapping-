# Character Relationship and Emotional Evolution Visualization

This project visualizes character relationships and tracks the emotional evolution of characters within a narrative. Using Python libraries like **matplotlib** and **networkx**, it loads character data from a JSON file and creates various plots to showcase character growth over multiple chapters.

- Builds a network graph to display relationships between characters using `networkx`.

### Tracking Emotional Evolution Over Chapters

- Tracks emotional conflict levels for specific characters across multiple chapters.
- Plots emotional conflict using line charts.

### Tracking Motivations and Internal Conflicts

- Tracks and visualizes motivations and internal conflicts for characters.
- Creates bar plots to visualize how character motivations evolve over chapters.
